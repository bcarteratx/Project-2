### Date: 3/6/2020

### ***Description***

##### My sister-in-law Kim is an avid trail runner who wanted to do something about all the trash she saw along the trails she was running. Along with her friend Anne, a fellow running enthusiast, she started a volunteer group to clean up thier local trails while building a stronger trail running communtity. Now that their organization is growing they need a better way to keep track of thier events and volunteers. The goal of my app is to give them a place to upload event and volunteer data more easily.
